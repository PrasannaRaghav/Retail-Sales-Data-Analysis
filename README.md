2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

Record Count: Total number of records identified.

Customer Count: Number of unique customers extracted.

Category Count: All unique product categories listed.

Null Check: Records with missing values were identified and removed.

📊 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The dataset was explored to answer several business-related questions.
Here is a summary of the insights derived:

✔ Daily Sales Insights

Analyzed sales on specific dates to understand daily performance.
